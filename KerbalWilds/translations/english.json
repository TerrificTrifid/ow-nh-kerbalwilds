		"MohoMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Moho figures in Kerbal mythology as a fiery place with oceans of flowing lava. In reality however, it's much less interesting.</color>]]>",
		"MohoMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Scientists speculate about possible ways to make it \"awesome like in the stories\". Some of those ideas have led to new breakthroughs in aerospace technology.</color>]]>",
		"MohoMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=magenta>antipode</color>]]>",

		"EveMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=magenta>Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It’s one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint.</color>]]>",
		"EveMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=#BF3FFF>It is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to Kerbin. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures.</color>]]>",
		"EveMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?</color>]]>",

		"GillyMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve. It’s by far the smallest natural satellite that the Kerbal Astronomical Society has discovered.</color>]]>",
		"GillyMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Due to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has now become synonymous with being an accomplished Astronomer.</color>]]>",

		"MinmusMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin. From the surface of Kerbin, it can be seen on clear days as a tiny blue speck in the sky.</color>]]>",
		"MinmusMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>It is often mistaken as dirt on telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us it is a real moon nevertheless.</color>]]>",

		"IkeMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Ike is a relatively large, grey object occasionally seen orbiting Duna.</color>]]>",
		"IkeMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Scientists have postulated that Ike is seemingly perfectly positioned to sneakily interfere with any object that presumes to come orbiting near its parent.</color>]]>",
		"IkeMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=red>something like theres a pyramid on duna ooooo spooky</color>]]>",

		"JoolMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky.</color>]]>",
		"JoolMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration.</color>]]>",
		"JoolMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>If you look at Jool through a telescope, it is fuzzy.</color>]]>",

		"LaytheMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Kerbin.</color>]]>",
		"LaytheMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that “telescopes don’t work that way.</color>]]>",
		"LaytheMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>The intern was shortly afterwards “promoted” and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.</color>]]>",

		"VallMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Vall was one of the last Moons of Jool to be discovered. Frustrated scientists kept attempting to wipe it off the lenses of their telescopes.</color>]]>",
		"VallMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Eventually after a rash of returned telescopes, Advanced Optics Co. finally decided to just tell them it was an actual object in the sky.</color>]]>",
		"VallMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=magenta>antipode</color>]]>",

		"TyloMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Tylo was the first moon of Jool to be discovered by the Kerbal Astronomical Society.</color>]]>",
		"TyloMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>After many failed attempts to take a flawless picture of Jool to hang on the office walls, it was finally discovered that the wandering white smear was indeed a moon.</color>]]>",
		"TyloMonolith3": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Scientists speculate that the view from the surface with Laythe, Vall and Jool overhead must be “quite something”.</color>]]>",

		"BopMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Bop is a small moon in the vicinity of Jool.</color>]]>",
		"BopMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>In Kerbal mythology, Bop is believed to be the home of the Kraken, a mischievous creature said to play with the ships of hapless explorers, by spinning them out of control until torn asunder, then casting them into oblivion.</color>]]>",

		"PolMonolith1": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>This moon was especially hard to spot, as it looks just like a pollen grain, particularly when observed through telescopes based near dusty fields.</color>]]>",
		"PolMonolith2": "<![CDATA[<color=lime>Pol was finally discovered when someone decided to write down the location of the pollen, after having given up on yet another failed attempt to be rid of the smudge.</color>]]>"
