## Credits
- Heightmaps are from [KittopiaTech Dumps](https://github.com/Kopernicus/kittopia-dumps/tree/master).
- The rest of the maps and the skybox were taken directly from KSP and belong to its creators.
- I can't find any official release of the music, but according to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osJqbovbH2A&list=PLTAcCeE2DCByBIN0RIev6mXmwtUXQ54UF&index=9) it's composed by Victor Machado.
- Everything else is created by me or from Outer Wilds.
